## Statistics description(how to understand)

### Frequency table
Frequency means the number of times a value  
appears in the data. A table can quickly show us  
how many times each value appears.  

### Relative frequency table
Relative frequency means the number of times a  
value appears in the data compared to the total  
amount. A percentage is a relative frequency.  

### Cumulative frequency table
Cumulative frequency counts up to a particular  
value.

### Mean
The mean is usually referred to as 'the average'.  

### Median
The median is the middle value in a data set  
ordered from low to high.  

### Range
The range is the difference between the smallest  
and the largest value of the data.  
Range is the simplest measure of variation.
